# Stax Provider

The Stax terraform provider is used to interact with resources supported by Stax.

## Getting Started

If your new to terraform then the hashicorp developer site has a great guide to getting up and running [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) with AWS.

Once you have terraform installed you will require the following.

1. An [API Token](https://www.stax.io/developer/api-tokens/) which can be created in the stax console. The token must have the `Read Only (API)` role to read using datasources, or `Admin (API)` role to create and manage accounts.
2. The [Stax Short Installation ID](https://support.stax.io/hc/en-us/articles/4537150525071-Stax-Installation-Regions) which hosts your Stax tenancy.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "installation" {
  description = "Stax Short Installation ID for your Stax tenancy's control plane"
}

variable "api_token_access_key" {
  description = "Stax API Token Access Key"
}

variable "api_token_secret_key" {
  description = "Stax API Token Secret Key"
}

terraform {
  required_providers {
    stax = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/stax-labs/stax"
    }
  }
}

provider "stax" {
  installation         = var.installation
  api_token_access_key = var.api_token_access_key
  api_token_secret_key = var.api_token_secret_key
}
```
